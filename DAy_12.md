# 📓 Daily Reflection  
No bug hunting today. Got pulled into other work that took over the whole day — just couldn’t carve out the time.  
Not every day is productive on the surface, but sometimes life throws side quests your way.

Tomorrow might be similar, but I’ll find a way to sneak in some recon or testing if I can.

## 🏋️‍♂️ Training Log  
Rest day — no exercise done.  
Body needed the break… mind kinda did too.
