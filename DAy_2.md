# üê∏ Day 2 ‚Äì Out of Scope but In the Zone  
*2025-04-18*

Not a heavy hunting day, but I did keep the rhythm going. Spent most of the session circling back to that same **GraphQL endpoint** ‚Äî still trying to peel off some new angles. Found a **DoS vulnerability**, which honestly felt like a win... until I realized it was **out-of-scope**.  
Welp ‚Äî not every bug gets to shine.

One of my earlier reports that had made it to **Triage** suddenly got bumped back to **‚ÄúNew‚Äù**.  
Why? Triager asked for **more info**.  
Kinda frustrating
