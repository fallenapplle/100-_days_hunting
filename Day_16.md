# 🛠️ Bug Bounty Reflection

Missed logging yesterday, but catching up now.

Currently engaged in manual testing on a public program. Not sure why I’m still glued to it, but there’s something genuinely enjoyable about the target—it keeps pulling me back.

Made some solid progress today:
- Discovered some helpful JavaScript-focused `grep` regex patterns shared by members in a Discord group (huge shoutout to the community — very supportive).
- Identified a few internal links not accessible externally, possibly pointing to privileged endpoints or admin paths.

## 🧘‍♂️ Physical Training Log

Felt unwell tonight, so I kept it light:
- Bodyweight squats
- Standard pushups

Opted for rest afterwards to allow recovery.

## 📚 Write-Up Dive

Skimmed a few insightful writeups today, mostly focused on upload functionality vulnerabilities. Interesting reads and practical lessons:

- [Race Condition in File Upload Vulnerability](https://medium.com/@momenishine/race-condition-in-file-upload-vulnerability-c932285602aa)
- [Hijacking Sessions with IDOR and XSS](https://bxmbn.medium.com/hijacking-sessions-with-idor-and-xss-bxmbn-396f99761a85)
