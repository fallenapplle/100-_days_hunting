# 🐸 Day 1 – Electricity Wrecked, But the Grind’s On  
*2025-04-17*

Today marked **Day 1** of my *100 Days of Hunting* challenge. Honestly, not the most explosive start — the **electricity was a mess** all day thanks to last night’s rain. Living here means dealing with **unreliable power and spotty internet**, which always hits the nerve harder when you're trying to stay consistent. But hey — we move.

### 🔍 Hunting Session

Got a little window around **12:00 PM**, so I jumped into a **public program** — well-tested and noisy, but still a decent sandbox to sharpen skills. Spotted a **GraphQL endpoint** that looked promising. Sadly, **introspection was disabled** (as expected), so I couldn’t map out the schema directly.

Switched to **research mode** and summoned my virtual sidekick (**ChatGPT**) to brainstorm some angles. Picked up a few ideas:
- Automate some endpoint discovery.
- Click on everything like a madman (classic).
- **Dig through client-side JavaScript for GraphQL references** — this one’s 🔥 and going on my checklist.

### 🧪 GraphQL Recon

While poking around manually, I found a few endpoints that were public and seemed to fit the schema. Still a lot of unknowns, but I’m getting a feel for how this app is structured. The surface is just cracked — there's definitely more under it.

### 🧘 Free Time & Training

Didn’t go full throttle on hunting today — a lot of energy went into **research, reading, and recovering**. Rounded off the night with a bodyweight workout to stay sharp:
- ✅ Tuck Planche Pushups  
- ❌ Straddle Planche (still failing — but we fight on)  
- 🤸 Handstand attempts  
- 💎 Diamond Pushups  
- 🔁 Sit-ups & Planche Leans
