# ⛓️ Recon Rants & Terminal Thoughts – Day 7

## 📓 **Write about your day**  
> Hello everyone, hope you're doing well on your side of the screen.

Today’s session was kind of a blur — did some recon on a public program, still chasing ghosts in GraphQL. No juicy bugs, but not giving up. Got solid support from @tabaahi (shoutout bro 🙌) — really helped me connect some dots and made me feel a lot more confident. Needed that.

That old bug? Back in triage again. Got slapped with a low impact tag… again. Told the triager the CVSS doesn't really make sense, tried to explain the context — now just waiting to see what comes next. Hope they read it properly this time.

GraphQL still kicking my butt, but the curiosity's alive. Something’s lurking there, I can feel it.

## 💪 Training Log  
- Tried to move from tuck planche to **advanced tuck** — got folded by gravity real quick 💀 not even 1 second hold.  
- Handstand game took a hit too… couldn’t even balance today. Last time I was pumping out 2 HSPUs like it was nothing.  
  Now? Just vibes and disappointment.  
But whatever — it’s all part of the game. Gotta rebuild, get stronger, bounce back. No excuses.

See you tomorrow,  
@Fallenapple // peace-out 🕶️
