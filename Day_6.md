### 🧠 **Daily Reflection**

Woke up around 8 AM and kicked off the day with breakfast and straight into hunting. Focused on the same public program as yesterday, but today I shifted gears—left GraphQL aside for a bit and started poking around other domains via recon.

Found a lot of interesting stuff during recon, though no valid bug yet. Midway through, I pinged @tabaahi about a bug I had reported earlier—he gave some solid feedback and helped clarify the actual issue. Big shoutout for that assist 🙌

Post-lunch, I caught a short nap, recharged, and got back to hunting again. Ended the session by diving back into GraphQL research. I seriously want to speedrun learning this area—it’s starting to feel like a goldmine.
