*2025-04-30* | **Day 13 — Ghost Subdomains & Git Traps**


# 🧠 Field Log  
Started the morning around 8 AM and wrapped up some previously pending work. Submitted it — but as expected, got hit with revision requests from the person who assigned it. Spent some time adjusting and re-sending.

Later in the afternoon, I jumped into public program recon. Found a **juicy subdomain** hinting at potential BAC/IDOR action… only to realize it was flagged as **Out of Scope** 😤. After the hit, I pivoted to a private program for the rest of the session — progress is slow, but the surface is wide open.
