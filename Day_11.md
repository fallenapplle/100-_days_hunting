# 📓 Daily Reflection  
Today was tough — a lot of house work left me completely drained.  
Didn’t get to hunt much, but managed to handle some *other important tasks* (can’t disclose for now).  
That work ate up a lot more time and energy than I expected.

Meanwhile, one of my triaged reports moved forward again — this time program staff sent it to their internal team!  
Fingers crossed for a positive outcome. 🤞

## 🏋️‍♂️ Training Log  
Still showed up for the grind, even when tired:

- Advanced Tuck Planche — managed to hold it briefly (huge win!).  
- Tuck Planche Pushups — still struggling, but pushed through 3 reps today.  
- Sit-ups for core strength.  
- Pike Pushups for shoulder and stability work.  
- Diamond Pushups for chest/triceps.

**Small steps forward are still steps forward.**
