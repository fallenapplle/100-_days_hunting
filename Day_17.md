# 🧪 Bug Bounty Log

Continued work on the same public program today.  
Discovered several hidden subdomains—some returned `404 Not Found`, but may still warrant deeper investigation.  
Spent some time on JavaScript analysis, though no concrete findings yet.

Majority of the day was spent assisting a friend with his project. Despite the time constraints, I was still able to make small progress on my own recon work.
