# 📓 Daily Reflection  
Started the day feeling a bit exhausted — GraphQL didn’t lead to anything concrete again.  
So I decided to shift gears: jumped into random recon, just digging without any fixed plan. 

And guess what? Found a **very juicy subdomain** loaded with features.  
I’ll be focusing on this for the next few days — might be something solid here.

## 🛠️ Subdomain Exploration  
Explored over 2000 requests already, trying to understand the workflow.  
- Tested for HTML Injection, but no luck — server-side validation is pretty strong.  
- Still learning how the app handles requests behind the scenes. Feels like it’ll pay off if I stay patient.

## 🏋️‍♂️ Training Log  
Strength coming back slowly but surely:

- Squats (volume session)  
- Tuck Planche Hold (still not able to do pushups yet)  
- Handstand — balance coming back, form looking cleaner  
- Basic pushups  
- Leg raises for core strength  
- Tuck Planche Leans and practicing for Advanced Tuck

That’s a wrap for today.  

**— See you soon!**
