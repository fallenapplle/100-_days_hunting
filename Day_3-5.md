# 🐸 Day 3–5 – Life Happens, Back to the Grind  
*2025-04-19 to 2025-04-21*

Sometimes, life just throws things your way — and this time, it was **family responsibilities** that pulled me away from the hunting desk.  
No hunting, no notes, no digging into GraphQL or reports — just real-life things that needed my attention.

But hey, that's part of the game too.  
Today marks the end of the break — time to **reset and reload**.
