*2025-04-24* | **Day 8 â€” APK Insights & GraphQL Threads**

# ðŸ““ Daily Reflection  
Today was a relatively light day in terms of active bug hunting, but still productive in its own way.

I spent some time exploring an APK and discovered a few interesting elements during extraction. While there wasnâ€™t a direct vulnerability found, it was an insightful exercise that helped me understand the structure better.

While browsing Twitter, I came across a post about GraphQL. I reached out to the author for a few tips, and thankfully, got two helpful ones:  
- How to extract GraphQL operations directly from APKs  
- A useful `grep` command, shared by my friend @bugoverflow â€” big thanks to him!

Additionally, I tested one functionality that initially looked promising but turned out to be a false positive. A bit disappointing, but thatâ€™s part of the process.

Looking forward to diving deeper tomorrow.  
Every small step still adds up to progress.

**Until next time.**
